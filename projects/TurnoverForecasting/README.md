# Predictive Maintenance System

## Overview

This project aims to predict equipment failures and estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) of components in manufacturing systems. By leveraging sensor data, it provides early warnings for maintenance scheduling.

## Dataset

- **Source**: NASA Turbofan Engine Degradation Dataset
- **Description**: Multivariate time series data capturing engine degradation metrics.

## Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify critical sensors.
- Regression models for RUL prediction.
- Deployment of an API or dashboard for real-time predictions.

## Tools and Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- FastAPI / Flask
- Plotly

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/Sharma-Pranav/Portfolio.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   `cd PredictiveMaintenanceSystem`
3. Install dependencies:  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the application:  
   `python app.py`

## Results

- Accurate predictions of RUL for different operational settings.
- Identification of key sensors influencing the prediction.
