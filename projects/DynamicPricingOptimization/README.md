# Dynamic Pricing Optimization

## Overview

This project focuses on creating a scalable solution for optimizing dynamic pricing strategies in retail and e-commerce. By leveraging machine learning models, it helps businesses maximize revenue and enhance competitiveness through real-time price adjustments.

## Dataset

-   **Source**: [Dynamic Pricing Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/dynamic-pricing-dataset)
-   **Description**: A dataset containing historical sales, pricing, and demand data for training and testing dynamic pricing models.

## Features

-   Preprocessing pipeline for structured retail data.
-   Machine learning models for price elasticity analysis and revenue optimization.
-   Real-time pricing recommendation engine deployed on Hugging Face Spaces.

## Tools and Libraries

-   Python
-   Scikit-learn
-   XGBoost
-   Hugging Face Transformers
-   Pandas, NumPy
