## Overview

This project builds an AI-driven dynamic pricing optimization model for retail and e-commerce. The solution leverages machine learning algorithms to adjust pricing strategies in real-time based on historical trends, demand elasticity, and external market conditions.

## Dataset

- **Source: ** [Dynamic Pricing Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/dynamic-pricing-dataset)
- **Description: ** A dataset containing historical sales, pricing, and demand data to train models for price elasticity analysis and revenue maximization.

## Repository & Deployment

- ðŸ”— **GitHub Repository: ** [View on GitHub](https://github.com/Sharma-Pranav/Portfolio/tree/main/projects/DynamicPricingOptimization)
- ðŸš€ **Live Demo: ** [Try on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/PranavSharma/RidePricingInsightEngine)

## Features

- Automated price optimization using machine learning.
- Real-time pricing strategy recommendations.
- Deployment-ready interactive dashboard using **Gradio**.

## Tools and Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Hugging Face Spaces
- Gradio (for interactive model deployment)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/Sharma-Pranav/Portfolio.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   `cd RetailDemandForecaster`
3. Install dependencies:  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the Streamlit app:  
   `streamlit run app.py`

## Results

- Enhanced forecasting accuracy through feature engineering.
- Visualization of key trends and seasonality.
